# Dotfile for the tools i use.

my hunt for my tiling wm.

here is the list of wms ive tried over the past few years.

- Hyprland
- Sway and SwayFX
- i3
- dwm
- AwesomeWM

notable mentions:
- dwl
- river


here im going to explain why i didnt use most of these wms for a long period time.

dwm: i attemted to use this wm 2 spreate times. and the main point of me not using it what my profiency in C. i really wished i could have used it. the same for dwl but i havent tried it.

i3 - its easy to config. it just works. the main thing that made me move was not being able to use differnt layouts, compositors on x11 (picom) and bars (polybar & i3blocks)

awesomeWM - awesome has the highest learning curve ive ever seen. the docs were hard to find and its not easyily configurable unless you really know what youre doing. you have to use the git verison because the latest release is like 4 years old and the git version of the docs too. although awesome look very cool it has its own bar, dock, modules, notifiations and other stuff too.

sway and swayFX - its awesome. i3 without the i3 problems ( execpt for not being able to change layouts ). the main issue for me is maximize, fullscreen and fake fullscreen. sways main delevoper has stated that they wont be add this becuase i3 dosent have it (which is stupid) but it being wayland with chromium based browsers breaks it. when i mod+f i what it to fullscreen the current app but not maximize it so that brave ( my current browser ) hides the url bar and tabs i have to exit full screen to get those back. with dwm and hyprland im able to control fullscreen maximize and fake fullscreen ( maximize but limited to its continer size ). if it werent for this id be using sway it much more stable than hyprland and REAPER the DAW i use works fine on sway unlike on hyprland.


so heres a simple version of it:

dwm / dwl: want to use but dont know C well

i3: layouts x11 compoiors and bars

awesomeWM: very steep learing curve

sway / swayFX: fullscreen issues and layouts
